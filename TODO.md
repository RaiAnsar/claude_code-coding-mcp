# Enhanced MCP Server - Project Roadmap

## üöÄ Current Status (January 2025)

**Phase 1 Complete!** We've built the foundation that gives OTHER AIs persistent memory:
- ‚úÖ Each AI (Gemini, Grok, ChatGPT, DeepSeek) has per-project context
- ‚úÖ Context persists across Claude conversations
- ‚úÖ /clear command synchronization works
- ‚úÖ MCP protocol intercepts and injects context automatically

## üéØ What's Next (Immediate Priorities)

### 1. **Complete AI Service Integration** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Connect to actual Gemini API
- [ ] Connect to actual Grok API
- [ ] Connect to actual OpenAI API
- [ ] Connect to actual DeepSeek API
- [ ] Handle API errors gracefully
- [ ] Add retry logic and fallbacks

### 2. **Database Setup & Testing**
- [ ] Create database initialization script
- [ ] Add database migration support
- [ ] Set up test database
- [ ] Create integration tests
- [ ] Add health check endpoints

### 3. **Installation & Documentation**
- [ ] Create step-by-step installation guide
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section
- [ ] Create video demo
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Add example conversations
